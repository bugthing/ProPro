ProPro
======

ProPro is me scratching my own itch, I have scratch before using Perl, but got
abit bogged down with having to manage every aspect myself (which my my failing,
not Perl!) .. I thought I'd give it another blast, this time using Ruby and Rails.

It is a re-write of Flowella, this time it should be cleaner and using Rails 
should be abit nicer to manage.

I am using [OpenShift](http://propro-bugthing.rhcloud.com/) to host this project
as not only do RedHat provide a greate service for free, but if (for some amazing
reason) it gets used, it can be easily stepped up.

ToDo
====

*  Create REST API
*  Add EmberJS
*  User sign up
*  API Access control (token based)
