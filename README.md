ProPro
======

ProPro is me scratching my own itch, I have scratch before using Perl, but got
abit bogged down with having to manage every aspect myself (which my my failing,
not Perl!) .. I thought I'd give it another blast, this time using Ruby and Rails.

It is a re-write of Flowella, this time it should be cleaner and using Rails 
should be abit nicer to manage

ToDo
====

*  Create REST API
*  Add EmberJS
*  User sign up
*  API Access control (token based)
